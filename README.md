### Description

It's a mail sender which DOESN'T NEED A SMTP SERVER! Also, you can specify how many times you want to send the mail, workin as a spammer for 'some' ppl. Most of the code was adopted from Bryan Cairns's 'Send mail without server', most credits given to him. BUT i really improved the GUI.

Pls............vote for it and leave comments. Pls.
